Building open, reproducible frameworks for multi-omic data integration, spatial transcriptomics, and computational pathology.

## üî¨ Research Vision

My work focuses on developing **interpretable and reproducible AI frameworks for cancer genomics**, uniting biological prior knowledge with multi-omic and spatial data. The central goal is to replace black-box prediction with **mechanistic understanding**‚Äîmodels that not only perform well but explain how genomic alterations, perturbations, and drug responses reshape cellular states. Each framework in this series emphasizes **pathway- and network-level interpretability**, **cross-dataset generalization**, and **transparent benchmarking**, establishing reproducible standards for computational oncology. Through this approach, I aim to bridge **machine learning, systems biology, and translational research**, advancing models that predict, explain, and validate biological mechanisms.
