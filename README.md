## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Computational Biologist | Cancer Genomics & Interpretable AI

Welcome to my GitHub!  
 
I develop **interpretable machine learning frameworks for cancer genomics**, with a focus on connecting high-dimensional data to mechanistic biological insight. My work spans **multi-omic integration, perturbation modeling, spatial transcriptomics, and drug response prediction**, always emphasizing reproducibility, interpretability, and translational impact.

## üî¨ Research Vision
How do genomic alterations and perturbations reprogram cancer cell states and expose vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically? To answer this, I build models that are **predictive but also mechanistically informative**, avoiding black-box predictions and instead revealing **pathways, subnetworks, and signaling hubs** that drive tumor behavior.

Graph neural network for **drug sensitivity prediction** in cancer cell lines.  
- Integrates **multi-omic features, drug descriptors, and prior knowledge graphs**  
- Uses a **pathway bottleneck** for mechanistic interpretability  
- Focuses on **cross-panel generalization** (e.g., CCLE ‚Üí GDSC), a major challenge in pharmacogenomics
