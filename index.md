# Sally Yepes, Ph.D.
**Computational Biologist | Cancer Genomics & Interpretable AI**

I develop **interpretable machine learning frameworks** that integrate multi-omic and spatial data to uncover the molecular logic of cancer. My work combines **mechanistic interpretability, reproducibility, and biological grounding**, aiming to build research-ready frameworks rather than one-off analyses. Current focus areas include **spatial transcriptomics**, **drug-response modeling**, and **graph-based multimodal architectures**.

## Research Vision

**Interpretable by design Â· Reproducible by construction Â· Generalizable across data modalities.**

My long-term goal is to establish **transparent and reusable computational standards** for cancer genomics frameworks that predict, explain, and generalize across tissues, datasets, and modalities.
